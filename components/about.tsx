  I started my journey in programming after my school, where I quickly discovered my{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">passion for coding</span>. To pursue this interest, I start learning from youtube, where I learned{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development and system design</span>. My favorite part of programming is the thrill of building projects and the problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the feeling of finally cracking a tough problem. My core tech stack includes{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">Next.js, Laravel, NestJS, and PostgreSQL</span>. Additionally, I have experience with TypeScript, Vue.js, and MongoDB, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies. I am currently seeking a{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software engineer.

  <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy spending time with my family and friendsâ€”often playfully annoying my sister! ðŸ˜… I also love{" "}
